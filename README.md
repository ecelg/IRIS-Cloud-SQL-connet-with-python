# IRIS-Cloud-SQL-connet-with-python
Upload a csv to IRIS Cloud SQL, testing the connection with pyodbc


Recently I heard that there is a InterSystems IRIS Cloud SQL on AWS for fast deployment purpose.
At the same time, I am learning the way to talk to IRIS platfrom by Python.
I started this simple project for fun ^^"
